⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
2. Install dependencies
npm install
3. Configure your credentials

Open the main file (e.g. index.js) and add your Twitch credentials:

identity: {
  username: 'your_bot_username',
  password: 'oauth:your_token_here'
}

⚠️ Never share your OAuth token publicly.

4. Run the bot
node index.js
🔐 Configuration

To use this bot, you need a Twitch OAuth token.

You can generate one from Twitch or tools like Twitch Token Generator.

For better security, consider using environment variables (.env) instead of hardcoding your credentials.
